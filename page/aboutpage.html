    <h1 class="schoolname" id="topend"> BRIEF HISTORY OF KURAMO SENIOR COLLEGE</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            The Jakande Government created Kuramo College as one of the schools to address the lack of Primary/Secondary
            schools in Lagos State, which culminate into the morning and afternoon schooling system in the state.
        </p>
        <P>
            Formerly known as Kuramo College Igbose Village (KCIV), KURAMO COLLEGE Victoria Island (KCVI) is the present
            approval name of the academic institution. The Lagos State Government established Kuramo College on the 4th
            of August 1980. Prior to the government's approval of the school being named the aforementioned, Igbosere
            College was the name of the school. The move from Igbose to Victoria Island marked the the history of an
            enviable beginning for the students and the school itself.
        </P>
        <p>
            The first principal of Kuramo College was Mrs Olutayo O. Olude, a transferee from Reagan Memorial Girls
            School Yaba. On the 5th of December 1981, Mr C. O. Saibu became the principal with a record of being the
            longest serving principal of the school. For over four decades, eleven principals have effectively
            championed the affairs of the school within the juridiction of their duties.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the change of name, the government had to moved the school to a new location behind Eko Hotel and
            Suites. In February 1988, the school gained its permanent location at Bishop Aboyeade Cole Street, OFF
            Ligali Ayorinde, Victoria Island, Lagos State, Nigeria opposite Mobile Producing Head Office, Victoria
            Island. Kuramo College graduated its first set of students in the year 1985 of which many have studied
            further and became Lawyers, Doictors, Engineers, Accountants, builders, Community leaders, Lecturers,
            Politicians and more. The school has continued to produce brilliant students who have excelled in various
            fields of human endeavours.
        </p>
        <p>

            the school in the inter-collegiate debating society. Kuramo college had also produced sportmen and women who
